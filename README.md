# DeckOfCards
DeckOfCards is a Swift Playground that allows you to dabble with an Object-Oriented Deck of Cards.

## Instructions
Please clone the repository or download it as a zip file. Then hit the play button in the Playground!

If you want to look at the files manually, they can be found under `DeckOfCards/DeckOfCards.playground/Sources/`

## Data Types
The 3 main files describing the data types include:
  - `Card.swift`: Contains the `Card` structure that represents cards in a deck
  - `Deck.swift`: Contains the `Deck` class, which represents a deck of cards
  - `Error.swift`: Contains enumerations of the different types of errors that may arise in `Card` and `Deck` types 
  
The file `Contents.swift` (under `DeckOfCards/DeckOfCards.playground/`) shows the usage of our deck of cards. Please note that Swift Playgrounds use this file by default to run code.
